# Image-Compression-using-SVD

The repository contains an implementation of image compression using singular value decomposition by finding k-rank approximators for a given image matrix. Additionally, there is a pdf describing the code, showing its correctness, and explaining the theory behind the procedure. 

PDFs might be easier to view from drive.
